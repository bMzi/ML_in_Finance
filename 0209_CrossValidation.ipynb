    "### Dealing with Categorical Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Every machine learning process starts with a data set from which you wish to extract information. Feature engineering lies at the beginning of this process. It deals with cleaning data and the extraction or creation of features from the data set in order to facilitate the prediction of a response. The tools for data cleaning we discussed in the first three chapters. Thankfully, the data sets we use in this course are mostly already cleansed but you should be aware that in practice this is what consumes a significant amount of time. As for the feature extraction part, we saw an example of it in the chapter on KNN where we downloaded share prices and \"generated\" features (i.e. lagged returns) out of it. In that setup all of the feature values were of numerical kind. In the chapters on logistic regression, LDA and QDA we worked with the 'Default' data set. This set had a **binary categorical feature** (e.g. student: yes/no). In order to work with these string values we simply used Pandas' `factorize()` function. Here's the code we applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "`# Factorize 'No' and 'Yes' in columns 'default' and 'student'\n",
    "df['defaultFac'] = df.default.factorize()[0]\n",
    "df['studentFac'] = df.student.factorize()[0]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For the case of binary categories this works perfectly fine. But what if the number of categories is greater than two? How should we deal with it? To illustrate this, imagine the following sample data set: "

    "Well, if we would follow through with this approach and feed these values into a Scikit-learn ML function, the model would make the fundamental assumption that bricks > concrete > wood. Furthermore, we have numerical values for `dist` (the districts of Zurich) where we know precisely that these represent categorical values (2 = Wollishofen, 5 = Industrie, 9 = Altstetten, 12 = Schwamendingen). And this - geographic or demographic jokes aside - would not make much sense (VanderPlas (2016)). Houston we've got a problem! \n",

Instead, we should make use of a method called **one-hot encoding**, which effectively creates extra columns with dummy variables (booleans) indicating the presence of a category with a value of 1 or 0, respectively. There are numerous ways of encoding categorical values. In this chapter we will briefly touch upon Pandas' and Scikit-Learn's tools.

    "The alternatives in Scikit-learn are called `LabelEncoder` (equivalent to `pd.facorize()`) and `OneHotEncoder()` (similar to `pd.get_dummies()`). Their setup is a bit more abstract and cumbersome, but it also has advantages compared to Pandas' solution. For example the `OneHotEncoder()` can be used in Scikit-learn pipelines and it returns a sparse matrix which is highly efficient computationally. But for the sake of brefity we will not go into too much detail here but simply show for reference how these Scikit-learn functions are applied. Ultimately it is at this stage a question of preference what functions you want to use for your task. Important is just that this step is done at the very beginning of the process - even before a train-test split is applied. That way you make sure the mapping is the same for both train and test split."

    "The output here is a sparse matrix. Computationally and from a data storage perspective this is highly efficient because the matrix contains only integers as entries. However, the print-out of this sparse matrix is less indicative. All column labels are empty. To make sense of it we have to understand the setup of this sparse matrix. Each column is a binary representation of a value. The first column indicates which of the rows had a `dist=12` (only row index 2), second `dist=2` (only row index 1), third `dist=5`, fourth `dist=9`, fifth `fab=bricks` etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "In section 4.5 of the script we have briefly touched upon the importance of randomly splitting our data into a training set (to train/calibrate our ML algorithms) and a test set (to evaluate the accuracy of our model). As [Pedregosa et al. (2011) put it in the scikit-learn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html): \"*Learning the parameters of a prediction function and testing it on the same data is a methodological mistake: a model that would just repeat the labels of the samples that it has just seen would have a perfect score but would fail to predict anything useful on yet-unseen data. This situation is called overfitting. To avoid it, it is common practice when performing a (supervised) machine learning experiment to hold out part of the available data as a test set `X_test, y_test`.*\" The split ratio is somewhat arbitrary but literature suggests a range between 60:40 (train:test) and 80:20 for smaller samples and 90:10 to 99:1 for large sets (several thousands of observations) (Raschka (2015)). \n",
    "\n",
    "In its `model_selection` submodule scikit-learn offers a convenient function called `train_test_split` that randomly splits a data set into separate train and holdout sets. To show how this function is applied we first load the publicly available 'adult' data set. It includes 14 features from the 1994 US census that measure an individual's characteristics. The response vector is `income`. The prediction task is to determine whether a person earns over 50K a year. For more information see [the data description](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult).  This is of course a fairly simple data set but will do for our purposes. Nevertheless, in reality related tasks such as this are fairly common for credit card companies, leasing firms or banks that need to verify a customer's application for a credit (card), leasing, loan etc. (One could design this either as regression task or classification task with an adequate number of classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we apply the `train_test_split` function we convert categorical columns in a first step - as learned above. "

    "## Feature Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature scaling is a crucial step in preparing data for ML applications. While some of the algorithms are invariant to the feature's scale (e.g. decision trees and random forests, which we will discuss in the next chapter), the majority of machine learning and optimization algorithms perform much better if features are scaled. The reasons are two-fold: for one, most ML algorithm have optimization functions to find the optimal coefficients/hyperparameter and these functions work more efficient on scaled values; for another, algorithms such as KNN, which use a distance measure, will put much more weight on features that have a larger scale than others (Raschka (2015), Müller and Guido (2017)). A good example for the latter is a data set that contains 'age' as well as 'income' variables. For a KNN model a difference in $1'000 salary is enormous compared to a difference of 10 years in age. Thus such a model would be driven by 'income' - and this would be contrary to our intuition (James et al. (2013)). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common approaches to bringing different features onto the same scale: **normalization and standardization**. Unfortunately these terms are often used quite loosely in different fields so that the meaning has to be derived from the context they are mentioned (Raschka (2015)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, normalization refers to the process of rescaling the features to a range of $[0, 1]$. This can be viewed as a special case of min-max scaling. In our context, we normalize a feature column $X_i$ by the following convention:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\n",

This would not be a good idea because of one particular reason: we would \"contaminate\" our model with information about the test set. If we were to do it we run the risk of having a very good model for our train AND test data but this model would perform poorly on new data that previously was not part of any train or test set. The effect of such an approach would be poor generalization. By the way, the same is true for feature selection. This too should not be done on the full set but only on a training set.**\n",

    "### Standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "When we need values in a bounded interval, normalization via min-max scaling is a useful technique. Yet for many machine learning algorithms standardization is a more practical approach. The rationale behind it is that most linear models (such as logistic regression, LDA or support vector machines) initialize coefficients/parameters/weights to small random values close to 0. By standardizing our features, we center the values at mean 0 with standard deviation of 1. This makes the computations easier to learn the coefficients/parameters/weights. Beyond that, standardization does not distort useful statistical information about outliers and with that makes the algorithm less sensitive to them in contrast to min-max scaling (Raschka (2015)). We express the process of standarizing a feature column by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\n",
    "X_{i}^{\\text{std}} = \\frac{X_i - \\bar{X}_i}{\\sigma_{X_i}}\n",

A ML algorithm is calibrated on the training set and then, to see how well our model generalizes to new, previously unseen data, applied to the test data. In this section we expand on aspects of evaluating a model by discussing cross validation (CV). This is a statistical method of performance evaluation that is more stable and thorough than a simple split into training and test set (Müller and Guido (2017)). \n",

We start with the `StratifiedKFold()` function. This is a slight variation of the standard CV introduced above. Stratifying in this context means that proportions between classes are the same in each fold. To evaluate classifiers this `StratifiedKFold()` function is usually preferred (over the simple `KFold()` function) as it preserves the class proportions and thus results in more reliable estimates of generalization performance.
