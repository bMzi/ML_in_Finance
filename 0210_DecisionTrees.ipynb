Cross-entropy is minimal if all samples at a node belong to the same class and maximal if we have a uniform distribution among the classes. Therefore, cross-entropy can be understood as a criterion that attempts to maximize the mutual information in the tree. The Gini-index on the other hand works towards minimizing the probability of misclassification. Similar to entropy it is maximal if classes are evenly distributed and minimal if the vast majority of samples belong to the same class. \n",

    "### Decision Trees and Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "We have mentioned above that one of the major disadvantages of decision trees is the risk of overfitting. Having discussed cross validation in the previous chapter, we ought to ask the question how cross validation can be used to prevent overfitting. The answer to this seemingly trivial question might be more complex than initially thought. If we apply a $k$-fold cross validation and generate $k$ decision tree for every fold in the training set, then these $k$ tree will most certainly look different from fold to fold. Each of the $k$ decision trees will still suffer from overfitting. Furthermore, CV does not tell us anything about which of the $k$ tree we are supposed to select for prediction, and ultimately, this ought to be our goal. If CV produces 10 different trees but doesn't tell us which one of these to choose, we have gained nothing. Choosing the one tree (among the $k$) with (for example) the lowest error rate will not do it as this approach is most probably flawed: such a model is based on even less information than what would be available through the full training set and in general models with more information beat those with less. So CV will not help us on this end. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, CV is still of use. To recapitulate the idea behind CV: Fundamentally, the purpose of cross validation is not to help select a particular instance of the $k$ decision trees but rather to qualify the model, i.e. to provide metrics such as error rate etc. which in turn can be useful in asserting the level of precision one can expect from the model. Therefore, CV comes into play when we are tuning the model to find the optimal hyperparameter. As an example: usually we do not know the optimal tree form. Does it generalize best when it has depth 2, 5, 10? Or is our stopping criterion to have no more than 5, 10, 20 observation per region $R_j$? Here we can run different parameter in combination with CV and this, thus, will provide an answer on how well the model will generalize to new data - given the set of hyperparameter. \n",

    "CV is so valuable because it provides reliable information on how well a model generalizes. Recall that given a set of $n$ independent observations $Z_1, Z_2, \\ldots, Z_n$, each with variance $\\sigma^2$, the variance of the mean $\\bar{Z}$ of the observations is given by $\\sigma^2/n$ (see appendix of the script). This shows that if we average a set of (independent) performance metrics (e.g. classification error), we actually reduce the variance of this error. And in doing so, we increase the validity of said metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we now extend this idea to not only assessing performance metrics but also predicting outcomes, we enter the field of **ensemble models**. These models produce $k$ independent predictions (e.g. trees) and assign the class label based on a majority vote of the $k$ outcomes. In doing so we lower the variance without compromising on the low bias of decision trees. Therefore it is easy to see that ensemble methods have proven to be extremely valuable, especially in the field of decision trees. The most prominent ensemble algorithm with respect to decision trees is called 'Random Forest'.\n",

    "3. Repeat steps 1. and 2. $B$ times \n",
    "4. Aggregate the $B$ predictions (of each tree) and assign the class label by majority vote\n",
    "\n",
    "Step two above might seem odd at first: Why would we restrict the model to only choose from a subset $m$ of features (instead of selecting from the complete set $p$)? This is best explained with James et al. (2013, p. 320)'s words:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Suppose that there is one very strong predictor in the data set, along with a number of other moderately strong predictors. Then in the collection of bagged trees, most or all of the trees will use this strong predictor in the top split. Consequently, all of the bagged trees will look quite similar to each other. Hence the predictions from the bagged trees will be highly correlated. Unfortunately, averaging many highly correlated quantities does not lead to as large of a reduction in variance as averaging many uncorrelated quantities. [...] Random forests overcome this problem by forcing each split to consider only a subset of the predictors. Therefore, on average $(p - m)/p$ of the splits will not even consider the strong predictor, and so other predictors will have more of a chance. We can think of this process as *decorrelating* the trees, thereby making the average of the resulting trees less variable and hence more reliable.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "On a side note: There exists a predecessor algorithm that works similar to random forests except that it sets $m=p$ in step 2.1 per default. Python has it implement as `BaggingClassifier()`. Since random forests improves on the problem of correlated features, it is today clearly the preferred approach. For this reason we will only discuss the random forest implementation.\n"

    "Though the interpretability of a random forest does not meet that of a simple decision tree, a big advantage is that we do not have to worry that much about choosing good hyperparameter values. We have three primary values to set: \n",
    "* The size $n$ of the bootstrap (step 1)\n",
    "* The subset $m$ of possible features (step 2)\n",
    "* The number of iterations $B$ (step 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the larger number of trees $B$, the better the performance of our random forest classifier. But this of course comes at the expense of (potentially significant) increased computational costs. Additionally, the model improvement decreases as the number of trees is increased, i.e. at a certain point the cost in computation time will outgrow the benefit in prediction accuracy from more trees. In the Scikit-learn implementation, this hyperparameter is steered through the `n_estimators` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature subset size ($m$) to consider at each node is typically set to $m = \\sqrt{p}$, that is, the number of predictors considered at each split is approximately equal to the square root of the total number of predictors $p$. Scikit-learn uses the `max_feature` argument to control for it. \n",

    "Finally, via the size $n$ of the bootstrap we control the bias-variance trade-off. A large value for $n$ will decrease randomness and thus such a model is more likely to overfit. On the other hand, preventing overfitting by selecting smaller values come at the expense of the model predictive performance. Since predictive accuracy is what we are most interested in, the vast majority of random forest implementations, including the `RandomForestClassifier` implementation in Scikit-learn have set the bootstrap sample size $n$ per default to the number of samples in the original training set. This provides a good bias-variance trade-off (Raschka (2015)). "

    "There is an easily accessible implementation of a random forest classifier in Scikit-learn that we can use. For [a description of the available hyperparameter please check again the function's documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html). It is also left to the reader to investigate how CV and/or grid-search can improve the performance. For this the same steps as explained for the `DecisionTreeClasifier` function can be applied."
