    "## Estimating the Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a logistic regression we need to estimate the $\\beta$ coefficients in above equation. In the linear regression setting we used a least squares approach. Here, however, we switch to a method called **maximum likelihood**. This approach is used in many areas of statistics/machine learning to fit models and as such often studied in graduate courses. Here we will restrict ourselves to a very superficial discussion of the intuition. For the interested reader, [Elkan (2014)](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~elkan/250B/logreg.pdf) provides an excellent, concise introduction, whereas Bishop (2006) has a more advanced and thorough discussion of the topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the intuition: maximum likelihood optimizes the Logit-equation to get estimates of $\\beta$ \"such that the predicted probability $\\hat{p}(x_i)$ of default for each individual [$\\ldots$] corresponds as closely as possible to the individual's observed default status. In other words, we try to find $\\hat{\\beta}_0, \\hat{\\beta}_1, \\ldots, \\hat{\\beta}_p$ such that plugging these estimates into the model for $p(X)$ [$\\ldots$] yields a number close to one for all individuals who defaulted, and a number close to zero for all individuals who did not.\" (James et al. (2013, p. 133)). \n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum likelihood function that is used to estimate the $\\beta$ coefficients in the logistic regression model, is derived from the probability distribution of the dependent variable $y$. Since $y$ takes on one of two values (in our example $y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$) and assuming the response values are independent of each other, the probability mass function of $Y$ follows a Bernoulli distribution, $Y \\sim Bern(p)$, which is a special case of the Binomial distribution $Bin(n, p)$ with $n=1$. Its probability mass function is \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "f(y;p) = p(Y=y) = p^y (1-p)^{1-y} = \n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "p & \\text{ if } y=1 \\\\\n",
    "(1-p) & \\text{ if } y=0 \n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The joint probability mass function of $Y$ is \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "f(y | \\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^N p(x_i)^{y_i} \\, (1-p(x_i))^{1-y_i}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "and describes the values of $y$ as a function of known, fixed values for $\\beta$, where $\\beta$ is related to $y$ through the logistic function. Since we don't know the coefficients $\\beta$ but have measured outcomes for $y$ the likelihood function reverses above joint probability mass function such that it expresses the values of $\\beta$ in terms of known, fixed values for $y$. This is the likelihood function ([Czepiel (2002)](https://czep.net/stat/mlelr.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "L(\\beta | y) = \\prod_{i=1}^N p(x_i)^{y_i} \\, (1-p(x_i))^{1-y_i}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum likelihood estimates are now those values for $\\beta$ which maximize the likelihood function $L(\\beta | y)$. Typically, to find the maximum likelihood estimates we would differentiate the (log-) likelihood with respect to the coefficients, set the derivatives equal to zero, and solve. However, there is no closed-form solution for this and thus numerical methods (such as Newton-Raphson, Newton-conjugent gradient etc.) are required to derive a maxima ([Shalizi (2017)](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ADAfaEPoV.pdf)). Thankfully, statistical packages such as Python's `statsmodels` have these necessary tools integrated into the relevant functions such that we do not need to concern ourselves with the details. \n"

    "For reference we show below how logistic regression is run with Scikit-learn. Unfortunately, there is no summary output available in Scikit-learn like there is within the Statsmodels package. The main reason is that sklearn is not used for statistical inference but for predictive modelling/ML and the evaluation criteria are based on performance on previously unseen data. \n",

A good example is [this answer on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28256058/plotting-decision-boundary-of-logistic-regression) where the decision boundary is drawn and the color scheme follows the probability of the response.

Yet the tools and measures necessary to understand the output are yet to be introduced. For this we refer to the chapter on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) (and subsequent chapters) where many tools are introduced that are of significant help in analyzing an algorithm's output."
